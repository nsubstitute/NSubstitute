# FAKE - F# Make

"FAKE - F# Make" is a build automation system. Due to its integration 
in F#, all benefits of the .NET Framework and functional programming can be used, including 
the extensive class library, powerful debuggers and integrated development environments like 
Visual Studio or MonoDevelop, which provide syntax highlighting and code completion.

The new DSL was designed to be succinct, typed, declarative, extensible and easy to use. 
For instance custom build tasks can be added simply by referencing .NET assemblies and using 
the corresponding classes.
