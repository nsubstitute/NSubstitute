about: Ask about how to do a specific task or how something works

**Question**
Ask away! If you are trying to do a specific task (e.g. how do I mock this event?), please include a code example to help us understand the context and potentially provide a sample answer. (StackOverflow's guide to [creating a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) may help with the sort of information to include.)
