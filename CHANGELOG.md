### 4.0.0 (January 2019)

_Promoted 4.0.0 Release Candidate 1 with no code changes. See the release candidate's notes
for a full list of changes since 3.1.0._

### 4.0.0 Release Candidate 1 (November 2018)

Thanks to core team member Alex Povar (@zvirja) for putting a huge amount of work into
defining and implementing features, fixes and refactoring for this release! Also thanks to
@tpodolak for the new NSubstitute.Analyzers project! Finally, thanks to everyone who
submitted PRs, raised or commented on issues, or took the time to help answer questions on StackOverflow.

#### Major new features and improvements

* [NEW] [NSubstitute.Analyzers](https://github.com/nsubstitute/NSubstitute.Analyzers) project.
Uses Roslyn to detect potential problems with NSubstitute configurations, such as trying
to substitute for non-virtual members. Whenever you add NSubstitute to your C# or VB project,
don't forget to also add the corresponding NSubstitute.Analyzers package!
Thanks to @tpodolak for starting and running this project!
* [NEW] `CallBase` for enabling base method calls for specific methods. (#449, @zvirja)
* [NEW][BREAKING] Arg matchers (`Arg.Is` etc) can now be used for `ref` and `out` arguments.
See [BreakingChanges.md](BreakingChanges.md) if you are still using pre-C#7. (#404, @zvirja)
* [NEW] `Configure()` extension in `NSubstitute.Extensions.ConfigurationExtensions` to
ensure NSubstitute handles the next call as a configuration/specification. (#350, @zvirja)
* [UPDATE] Performance improvements. (@zvirja)
    - `CallResults` performance optimisation
    - Delegate proxy generation improvements (#362)
    - Minimise allocations and LINQ use on hot code paths (#390)
    - Optimise array allocation (#395)
* [UPDATE][BREAKING] Calls made with one or more argument matchers (`Arg.Is` or `Arg.Any`)
will no longer return previously configured results. NSubstitute will assume the call is
being configured and avoid running logic configured via previous `Returns()` calls.
This helps fix some problems with overlapping configurations. See #345 and
[BreakingChanges.md](BreakingChanges.md) for more information. (@zvirja)

#### New and improved debugging, errors and error messages

* [NEW] Raise `CouldNotConfigureBaseMethodException` when trying to configure a call to
call a base method that does not exist. (#429, @zvirja)
* [NEW] Raise `RedundantArgumentMatcherException` if extra arg matchers are detected. This is
a huge help for immediately identifying misconfigured tests. (@zvirja)
* [UPDATE] Improved `AmbiguousArgumentsException` behaviour and errors. (#403 and others; @zvirja)
* [NEW] Improve debugging experience with proxy ids. (#39, @zvirja)
* [UPDATE] Improved display of `MatchArgs` to help with debugging. (@zvirja)
* [NEW][BREAKING] Detection of unused argument matchers. This helps to identify errors in tests
due to incorrectly used argument matchers. (#361, #89, #279; @zvirja)
